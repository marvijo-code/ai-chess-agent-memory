# Learning check

Each AI player writes only to its own folder (`agents/<folder>/`) and reads every other folder.

- Read in prompt: games where every move request carried the player's MEMORY.md (fingerprint sent by the engine).
- Read latest: games that started with the exact MEMORY.md the player wrote after its previous game.
- Memory / note updates: reflections that changed MEMORY.md / a notes file. Rejected: edits over a cap or outside the player's folder (the player gets one retry to shorten them).

Folders: DeepSeek V4.1 Flash: `agents/deepseek/`, GLM 5.3 Flash: `agents/glm/`, GPT-6.1 Sol: `agents/gpt/`, Sonnet 5.5: `agents/claude/`
