# Learning check

Each AI player writes only to its own folder (`agents/<folder>/`) and reads every other folder.

- Read in prompt: games where every move request carried the player's MEMORY.md (fingerprint sent by the engine).
- Read latest: games that started with the exact MEMORY.md the player wrote after its previous game.
- Memory / note updates: reflections that changed MEMORY.md / a notes file. Rejected: edits over a cap or outside the player's folder (the player gets one retry to shorten them).
- Lines: runs of 8+ consecutive moves in MEMORY.md (at most 6, none longer than 16 plies; a file over the limit must lose one line per reflection). Memory is for patterns, not long move sequences.

Folders: DeepSeek V4.1 Flash: `agents/deepseek/`, GLM 5.3 Flash: `agents/glm/`, GPT-6.1 Sol: `agents/gpt/`, Sonnet 5.5: `agents/claude/`
